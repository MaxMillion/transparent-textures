This might constitute actual spam, but I'm sending it out anyway:

For anyone design-inclined, I've started putting together a place in which I (slowly) take all of the patterns from Subtle Patterns (subtlepatterns.com) and make them transparent by removing the white/black values.

My biggest beef with Subtle Patterns has always been that, to colorize the patterns, you have to open each pattern in Photoshop, apply a Multiply filter, save it, upload it, etc. My goal with this site is to completely eliminate that friction by having the transparency built into the patterns.

If you check it out, let me know (a) how it runs on your computer, (b) if anything is unclear in terms of UX, (c) if you feel anything major is missing (the biggest TODO item on my list is the ability to "favorite" pattern/color combinations so you can come back later).

Let me know what you think. It hasn't been published anywhere but I feel like the design community would find this useful, so I'll probably share it with others at some point in the future.

(* Technically I started on Thursday night after brainstorming the idea with Evan, so not really a weekend project.)
